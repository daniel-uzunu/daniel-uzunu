Why are names important and how to come up with good names?

Code is primarily written in order to be easy to understand by humans. Of course, it is required to be able to transform our programs into executable machine code, but if this would have been the only concern while writing code, the assembly language would be a perfect choice (TODO: simplify this phrase). One of the most basic ways in which this goal can be achieved is choosing good names for variables, classes and class members. <!--more-->

However, finding good names is not an easy task.

Properties of good names:

- descriptive
- short?
