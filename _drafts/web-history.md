Today, the web looks like it was in our lives since the beginning of time. But it wasn't like this form the start. Like any other technology, the web competed with other technologies and it won. In this article I want to investigate which were the reasons the web won and which were the competing protocols. Apparently, the biggest advantage of the web was addressability.
