Dear reader,

Thank you for reading my blog. You are probably curious to know a few things about me. I'm a software developer. I like writing simple, easy to understand code.
Of course, I like challenging problems, but I don't like to make my job harder by writing code that is more complex than needed. The languages with which I worked the most are Java, Scala, C# and JavaScript.
