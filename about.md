I am a software developer. Most of my work is focused around the web, building web applications and services. The programming languages I used the most are Java, Scala, C# and JavaScript. I am also familiar with C/C++, Python, Haskell and Go.

I believe that KISS is the most important principle to be followed when developing software. Finding simple solutions is hard, but this principle should be followed in order to produce software that is easy to understand and modify. I see other principles, like DRY, YAGNI or SOLID as more specific guidelines on how to achieve simplicity.
