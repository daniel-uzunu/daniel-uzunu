# MongoDB replica to be used for testing

I want to develop an open surce MongoDB replica to be used for testing. It should start very fast aand it should be very efficient for operations that involve a low volume of data. No mocking will be required in tests as this replica will use the same wire protocol as MongoDB.

# Open source library for mocking REST services

Start a web server and instruct it to emulate the behaviour of a REST service (this will usually be a external dependency of the code under test)
