## A  Practical Guide to Layering / System Design

In this article, I would like to write about how to layer your application (what are layers, how to use them). I would also like to touch system design topics, e.g. micro-services. I should add concepts like scalability and logging to the mix.

Using a separate artefact for the model that is shared between the business layer and the data layer.

In this article, I will make a list of best practices, describe them and highligt the effects of the technical debt that accumulates by not following these practices.

## Metrics for Quality, Productivity, Technical Debt, Interest Being Paid

I know that it is very hard to measure these things accurately, but I am curious if there are things that can be done. One major issue with software is that we cannot measure productivity. But maybe there are good enough estimates.

## Random Ideas

Telling beginners that it is easy to build software is like teaching someone how to build a dog house and then letting him to build a sky scrapper. This is bound to fail. When you build tools, it is important to design them so that it is easy for professionals two work with them, not for beginners to pick them up. Or maybe we need both, but we should advertise them as such. I never saw Lego pieces being advertised for building a real house.
